# C_Check-Given-4-points-make-square-or-rectangle

To find whether the given  4 points make square which is not in order:
          1. Take 1 point (X)  and find distances between other 3 points to the fixed point (X).
          2. If any 2 distances are equal and other distance is double of the distance then it must be a square.
NOTE:
          The diagonal of a square is double value of the side.
